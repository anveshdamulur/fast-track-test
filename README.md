# Simple-Quiz

Created simple quiz by using Vue js.
## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)

# Usage

1.npm create vite
2.npm install (it will install all dev dependencies)
3.npm run start:dev 

# Output

Once you run last npm cmd you can see the website in browser.

# Note

There is scope to add new features but due to other commitments on my work. (I spend only 2 days to complete this task cause vue is new to me and I refer docs and watching some videos)
1. Filter the quiz by expreriance (easy ,medium or difficult)
2. Make beautifull UI
